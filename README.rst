===================
Pleiades Data Dumps
===================

Introduction
============

Data about the locations, names, and places of Pleiades is regularly written to
CSV format files. The descriptions of the records in these files and the code
that writes them is contained in this package.

Every object in Pleiades has a short name within the context of its container.
For places, these short names are typically numeric and their container is the
object at ``/places``. Location and name records contain both their own short
names (``id``) and the short name of their parent place (``pid``). This allows
the tables to be joined.

Downloads
=========

CSV files are available from http://atlantides.org/downloads/pleiades/dumps/.

Data Description
================

Locations, names, and places are dumped to separate files. All files are UTF-8
encocded. The first row contains column names. Columns will not be removed or
reformatted in future revisions of the dump files, but new columns may be
added and columns may be reordered.

.. attention::
   The order of columns is more or less arbitrary. When reading, please use a
   dictionary based reader such as Python's csv.DictReader, or convert the
   rows immediately into key/value pairs like this (Python example)::

     # rows is a sequence of lines from the CSV file.
     header = rows[0]
     records = list( dict(zip(header, row)) for row in rows[1:] )
